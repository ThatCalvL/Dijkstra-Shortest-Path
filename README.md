# Dijkstra-Shortest-Path
# In order to discover say "influencers", we need to repeatedly find shortest paths between all pairs of nodes. In this section, you need to implement Dijkstra's algorithm to discover shortest paths from a given source to all other nodes in the graph. The function offers one important additional feature, the function keeps track of multiple predecessors for a node on shortest paths from the source, if they exist. In the following example, while discovering shortest paths from source node '0', we discovered that there are two possible shortests paths from node '0' to node '1' (0->1 OR 0->2->1), so node '1' has two possible predecessors (node '0' or node '2') on possible shortest paths, as shown below.
# The basic idea is, the array of lists ("pred") keeps one linked list per node, and stores multiple predecessors (if they exist) for that node on shortest paths from a given source. In other words, for a given source, each linked list in "pred" offers possible predecessors for the corresponding node.
# The function returns 'ShortestPaths' structure with the required information (i.e. 'distance' array, 'predecessor' arrays, source and no_of_nodes in the graph)
